          <h2 class="section-heading">WATS400: Eastern Washington University</h2>

          <p>Even when I was a student there, I could never find anything that I was 
            looking for on the Eastern Washington University website. They've gone through a few updates since then but let's see if they've gotten any better.
          </p>

          <p>Place Holder (purpose)</p>

          <p>For the viewers at home, 
            I'm looking at Eastern Washington University (link to site)<a href="https://www.communitytransit.org/"></a>  </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Criteria (update before posting</h2>

            <p>I have separated my evaluation into 4 areas of Opportunity:
              <ol>
                <li>Design - How easy is the website to read? Are there any color contrast issues or font sizing issues that make it difficult to use the site? </li>
                <li>Content- Is the information provided concise and easily digestible? </li>
                <li>Function -Am I able to easily perform the functions that I want to? </li>
                <li>Creativity - Does this website have "sticking power" am I dawn back to this site because of the content, the images, the design?</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Can I Find What I'm Looking For?</h2>

          <p>So the site as a new design on the front page, there is a menu at the top right with options for Academics, About, Community, Apply, and the Search bar. 
            I'm going to look for the Computer Science program as a test:</p>

          <p>Via the search bar - I typed in "Computer Science" and clicked on the first result, and it worked. Not bad!
              Via the Academics tab - From Academics/Colleges/ Science, Technology, Engineering/ Landing page - There's a Program's folder and Computer Science link...and I'm here, a lot more work. 
              
               </p>

          <!--<blockquote class="blockquote">NOT SURE IF I REALLY NEED THIS NOW, TAKE OUT IF NO</blockquote>-->

          <h2 class="section-heading">Is the design consistent throughout the site?</h2>

          <p>The front pages of the website are a beautiful modern, clean design. However, 
            once the user gets into the program page, the website changes to a much older 
            more clunky design. The first time I saw the change I wondered if I had somehow 
            navigated away to a different website, it was very jarring. I like the cleaner 
            design, I hope it is the school's intention to incorporate it throughout the site.
            The order model is just so cluttered!
          </p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">Placeholder Image</span>-->

          <h2 class="section-heading">How is it to locate information on the site?</h2>

          <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/" alt="Image of the Community Transit Homepage">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Screenshot of the Community Transit Homepage</span>

          <p>Building off the navigate, the website is pretty easy to navigate, once you wrap your head around 
            the categories. When the information system fails though is when you get into the program-specific 
            page; once there, the styling changes and the website becomes very cluttered.  </p>

            <p>place holder</p>

              <h2 class="section-heading">Sticking power of the design- is it eye-grabbing or interesting?</h2>

          <p>The redesign is wonderful compared to the older parts of the site. The color-scheme: grey, black 
            and red is very easy to read and it's the official colors of the school. The information architecture 
            is a little clumsy, but there also is a lot of information to contain within the site. By nature, this 
            information has to be categorized into larger denominations. I had grumbled when I was trying to find 
            the Computer Science program page without using the search bar but honestly, I don't know how they could 
            have made in less clicks, other than listing all the programs as a list...which again is not very clean. </p>

            <!--<h2 class="section-heading">Function</h2>

          <p>placeholder </p>

          <p>Here's how my introduction to the Community Transit Site went, I was a new user using the website for the first time:</p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Arrived at the site, looking for buses in my area. Top left, "Bus Finder". Sounds perfect...It wants a stop number, not my address.<br>
                <br>Ok, that won't work; I don't know any stops close to me. </li><br>
                <li>Below the Bus Finder is the Trip Planner, that sounds promising.<br>
                   Enter in my address to start, ok it auto filled and that's right. Now the end 
                  location.<br> It can't find the address...and the search tool will not include city or zip.<br>
                  <br> Hmmm, I wonder if I can Google a transit hub close to work to use instead?</li><br>
                  <li>This was when I realized that I was using Google to find information specific to what I was looking for on the website. I, as the user had left the 
                    page to find the information I needed.<br>
                    <br> In the world of websites, this is not good. </li>
            </ul>
          </p>-->

          <p>There was so much information on the site, but the information I really needed was very hard to find.</p>

            <!--<h2 class="section-heading">Creativity</h2>

          <p>I am not drawn to this website at all. I am not happy to come back and check updates about public transit in Snohomish County. As a user, I was very frustrated as the 
            user when I tried to use the site. </p>

          <p>I can understand why so many people out here are unwilling to use the bus, they do not understand where the bus runs, how often it runs, or even where it goes.</p>

          <p>As more and more people move the region and traffic piles up (even more) public transportation is a cheap way to keep cars off the road and keep traffic 
            corridors open to commuters.</p>

            <p>The simplistic nature of the Community Transit website hides user issue after user issue. The website seems to be built more to house information and 
              news regarding Community Transit updates and projects rather than using the site to actually locate a bus or plan a trip.</p>-->

              <!--<h2 class="section-heading">Modest Proposal</h2>

          <p>For me as the user, the most important thing was finding transit in my area. I was shocked that there wasn't a tool for me to enter my address and search for stops in my immediate vicinity.</p>

          <p>The Bus Finder Tool implies that I should be exploring the area on foot and writing down the numbers of bus stops that I see in order to research their service routes later.  It's not the most effective system. </p>

          <p>The Trip Planner was not effective either, the search function does not allow for city or zip to be entered so if the tool does not have the address right the first time there is no way to enter in an address yourself. 
            In the end, Google was able to find me a route, and I was able to see all of the bus stops in my area by reverse-engineering Google's suggestions. </p>

            <p>After I knew what I was looking for, I went back to Community Transit to look at the route maps and schedules. Routes are grouped mainly by service locations (makes sense) but each route is kept 
              separate from the others on separate pages. </p>

              <p>From research, I knew that some of the busses overlapped on their route; I was surprised that I was unable to find a system map (or even a local system map) to see where the busses overlapped 
                so that I could research alternative routes. </p>

                <p>My biggest critique would be to allow a way for the user to locate the stops in their area easily. The user should not have to go to Google first and then come back armed with information. </p>

                <p>Building on the search function, it would be amazing if the search brought up a local-route system page with a local comprehensive map of all routes within walking distance of the user's address. 
                  Bonus points if the local system map included annotations at stops serviced by connector busses. Essentially, get the user (bus rider in this case) from home to a bus to work with the shortest time possible. </p>-->
