          <h2 class="section-heading">SO MUCH DATA!!!</h2>

          <p> So we all know that websites track what we do online. In a sense, it makes our internet time easier. 
            </p>

            <p>Imagine an internet where:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pages don't remember what you were looking at before.<i>*eeek!</i></li>
              <li>None of your payment information is held, so you have to enter it again!</li>
              <li>Remember having to log in EVERY SINGLE TIME?? <i>*whew!</i></li>
              <li>Remember remembering ALL of your passwords? <i>*The Horror!!</i></li>
            </ul>

            <p>We take for granted just how easy having that data out there has made it for us to brave the digital frontier, however this 
              luxury is not free. We provide marketers and advertisers with information about our likes and habits just by clicking away at 
              our machines. 
            </p>

            <p>Thankfully, Google makes those same tools available to just anyone so we can use all that data to find out what is working and what
              needs to be tweaked on our websites.
            </p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/nedstark.jpg" alt="An image of Ned Stark, across the page it reads, 'brace yourselves, shame is coming'">
              </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Brace Yourselves: Shame is Coming</span>

            <h2 class="section-heading">What Are We Looking For?</h2>

            <p>This week, we are using Google Analytics to peak into the demographics and habits of our users</p>

            <a href="#">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-dropdown-bad.JPG" alt="Image of the drop-down menu for my user science journal. The posts have been incorrectly labeled as 'post 1, post 2, etc.'">
              </a>
              <span class="caption text-muted">Image of the drop-down menu for my user science journal. The posts have been incorrectly labeled as 'post 1, post 2, etc.'</span>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Placeholder</h2>

            <p>
              Blah blah, about the tools and which ones im using. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Fix:</h2>

            <p>I went back over my journal and made sure to update the labels, especially in the navigation bar (shown below).</p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-code-dropdown-new.PNG" alt="Image of the edited code for the drop-down menu for my user science journal. The posts have been labeled as the name of the article they go to.">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Image of the edited code for the drop-down menu for my user science journal. The posts have been labeled as the name of the article they go to.</span>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Hypothosis</h2>

            <p>Before we get started, a few thoughts about my users and the sort of data I will see from them:</p>

            <p>We will attempt to focus on this statements:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>I expect most of my users to be in the 30's to 40's age bracket as those are the ages of most of my classmates and they are likely the most likely to click onto my USJ</li>
              <li>I expect most of the users to arrive on the homepage after clicking the link: <a href="https://natemeinhold.com/userScienceJournal/">Nate's Journal</a></li>
              <li>I expect most trafic to be coming from a desktop. I do my homework on a desktop, that's what I'd be looking on.</li>
              <li>I expect the <a href="https://natemeinhold.com/userScienceJournal/post6.html">Accessibility Post</a> to be the most popular...however that is mostly due to the meme of Ned Stark and my own foolish attempts at humor.</li>
            </ol>

          <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-code-alternatetag-new.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the coded alt tag updates, they read: 'EWU Computer Science Landing Page: an uncluttered template, 
              links are in a list on the left they say: programs, about, support cstem and contact us on the right is the mission statement:
              providing students with the tools to succeed in technology'">
            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Screenshot of EvergreenHealth Mainpage with Dev Consol, the tags have correctly labeled the photo as 'man plays with daughter'</span>

            <p>Using alt-tags is a minor inconvience while building a website however, it is much easier to put in while you're building rather than retro-fitting 
              the tags in later. </p>

              <p>I felt really silly going back to fix something so basic, especially after I told myself I would just "Code this fast" for the assingment. It ended up taking 
                way more time to fix it in the long run. 
              </p>

              <p> Alt tags are imperative to users who are using screen readers; especially when the images provide information vital to understand the page.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>
          <p><b>The Audit:</b></p>
          <p>Using tools such as Lighthouse and WAVE made it much easier to locate potencial issues and fix them. </p>

          <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-audit.PNG" alt="Image of my Lighthouse Audit Results. Performance = 68, Accessibility = 82, Best Practices = 100, SEO =89">
            </a> <span class="caption text-muted">Results of Lighthouse Audit</span>

            <p>They are not a perfect fix however, so there is some work required to double-check the tool. WAVE will take a deep look into your code and find possible errors.  </p>


            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-brokenlinks.JPG" alt="Screenshot of WAVE example. Three broken links are highlighted with red warnings">
          </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">WAVE finds broken links</span>

          <p>The tools are an excellent place to start. They will point out potencial issues and give you advice on how to fix them. But the developer is the one who has to go through their 
            code after to fix it. </p>

          <!--<blockquote class="blockquote">NOT SURE IF I REALLY NEED THIS NOW, TAKE OUT IF NO</blockquote>-->

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Accessibility is easier said than done. If you have never thought about how someone might be having issues navigating your website, it can be really hard to 
              understand why it is so important to make sure that your site is easily accessable.
              </p>

              <p>It took some work (not a lot) to add the features needed. It was mostly an exercise in frustration. All of these things are really easy to do right at the beginning
                but are very tedious to add in later. 
              </p>
              
          <strong>In Short:</strong>

          <ul>
            <li>Make sure to label well with alt-tags.</li>
            <li>Label Links with where they are going.</li>
            <li>Be sure to fill captions with useful information.</li>
          </ul>
         <p>With just a few easy changes, any site would be much more accessable for all users.</p>
