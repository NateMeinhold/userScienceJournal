          <h2 class="section-heading">Goals Revisted</h2>

          <p> Building off the <a href="post8.html" alt="GoogleAnalytics Goal post">Last Week's Post</a> this week we're going to be looking at
            how to make small changes to increase user traffic to your site. Or to funnel your users to where <strong>YOU</strong>want them to go!
            </p>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-A-googleimage.jpg" alt="Google Analytics logo, thank you to Crazyarts for the image">
              </a>
              <span class="caption text-muted">Google Analytics</span>

              <P>Why it matters:</P>

            <p>Knowing your users' habits on you site will help you develop a more user-friendly site.</p>
            
            <p>While predicting what they will do is never going to be 100%, some trial and error may surpise you.</p>
           
            <p>A simple change might:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Draw users to a previously ingnored page.</li>
              <li>Draw users to a previously read page (bad!).</li>
              <li>Drive up sales as clients find your products more easily.</li>
              <li>Increase Add Revenue if you can accomadate more users.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">What We're Testing this Week:</h2>

            <p><a href="post8.html" alt="GoogleAnalytics Goal post"> Last Week</a>, I added a link on the homepage to take users to the most recent post.</p>

            <a href="#">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-Goal-change.PNG" alt="image of my userScienceJournal homepage, there is a green link labeled check out my latest post">
              </a>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-2nd-goal-1st-goal.PNG" alt="image of my userScienceJournal homepage code, there is a gtag labeled check out my latest post">
            </a>

              <span class="caption text-muted">Latest Post <link rel="stylesheet" href=""></span>

              <p>For fun, I also made the text in the link green. There is no other green opject on the page, which makes the green text really stand out.</p>

              <p>This week, I added a link to the "latest post" (it's still post 8 though, as this page was not up and running at the time) within the drop-down navigation bar.</p>

              <p>I kept the green-colored link on the main page, it has a different gtag so it will not interfere with the results.</p>

              <a href="#">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-2nd-goal-pretty.PNG" alt="image of my userScienceJournal homepage, there is a green link labeled check out my latest post and a dropdown menu labeled latest post">
              </a>

              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-2nd-goal-dropdown.PNG" alt="image of my userScienceJournal homepage code, there is a gtag labeled check out my latest post on the drop-down menu">
            </a>

              <span class="caption text-muted">Latest Post Revamped <link rel="stylesheet" href=""></span>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Hypothosis</h2>

            <p>Before we get started, a few thoughts about my users and the sort of data I will see from this goal.</p>

            <p>This week I am expecting to see more goals completed (as there are now two goals on the site).</p>

            <p>I am expecting to see more page views on post 8 as that was the post the goals were linking to.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>

          <a href="#"> <!--results graph will go here-->
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-goal-maindetail.PNG" alt="Image of the audience overview from google, a jagged line shows activity rising and falling for the week of may 19 through may 25.">
            </a> <span class="caption text-muted">Google Audience Overview for the week of 5/19 to 5/25.</span>

            <p>This week was a little sad on data, I asked for some clicks a little later in the week and so they have not "resolved" on the Analytics paqe quite yet. <br><br>
              I only had my own clicks so far testing that the goals worked but I can always re-evaluate and re-submit this when I have a little more data to look through. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>What I noticed (from what I could see)</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>I'm still getting a trickle of new users, during a two week period there were 11 new users.</li>
              <li>Users spent an average of about 5 minutes on the site before leaving.</li>
              <li>Users looked at 13 pages before leaving!.</li>
            </ul>


            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-Goal-Overview.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Google Analytics page. charts indicate that I am getting more users">
          </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Detail of Google Analytics Goal Overview</span>

          <p>I was surprised to see that I am starting to slowly get some demographic information.</p> 
          
          <p>Below the main page, there was a section for where people are and for the language they speak. </p>

          <p>The first two sections were pretty normal; </br> Country: USA <br> Language: American-Style English (pretty impressive still but if you already know the country, this is a pretty good guess.) </p>

          <p>The cities are where it get's interesting..I expected the viewers to be from the Seattle-area...where we are. But I don't know anyone in San Antonio or in Ashburn to ask to look over my site from there.</p>

          <p>All of this information is cool to see where your audience is from, but it is kind of creepy being able to see as much of this.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-Goal-City.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Google Analytics page. charts indicate that my website has been viewed by people mostly in the seattle area but some in texas and virginia">

          <!--<blockquote class="blockquote">NOT SURE IF I REALLY NEED THIS NOW, TAKE OUT IF NO</blockquote>-->

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>I am still blown away by just how amazing these tools are for developers, I really would like to shoot</p>
                
              <p>I am just one developer, working on one tiny website, but I can't help to imagine what a tool this would be to a large website with millions of users</p> 
              
              <p>Facebook for instance: with enough active users, a developer could change something on the page and watch users move through the site in real time.</p>

              <p>They would know the instant a change had been made, or if the ad campaign is reaching their target audience. I feel like right know I am using Analytics for "good" but at the 
                same time, it is astounding just how powerful Google Analytics is for marketing. 
              </p>
