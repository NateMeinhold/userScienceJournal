          <p> The internet is a massive place filled with lots of different people and so many options to buy. If we are going to 
            sell anything to a potencial client, we need to know what content is best suited to attract our audience.  
            </p>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-A-googleimage.jpg" alt="Google Analytics logo, thank you to Crazyarts for the image">
              </a>
              <span class="caption text-muted">Google Analytics</span>

              <P>Enter Google Analytics</P>

            <p>Where once a market ad campaign would cost lots of money, Google Analytics is available free of charge to spy on your users.</p>
            
            <p>With the power of Google Analytics we can:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Collect data on user habits</li>
              <li>Research how and when users are accessing our website</li>
              <li>Get insight into where our clients are located</li>
              <li>Collect demographic information to see whom we are most popular with</li>
              <p>And most importantly:</p>
              <li>We can track whether or not our ad compaigns are landing in real-time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-heading">What We're Testing:</h2>

            <p>This week, I added a link on the homepage to take users to the most recent post.</p>

            <a href="#">
                <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-Goal-change.PNG" alt="image of my userScienceJournal homepage, there is a green link labeled check out my latest post">
              </a>
              <span class="caption text-muted">Latest Post <link rel="stylesheet" href=""></span>

              <p>For fun, I also made the text in the link green. There is no other green opject on the page, which makes the green text really stand out.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Hypothosis</h2>

            <p>Before we get started, a few thoughts about my users and the sort of data I will see from this goal.</p>

            <p>Because there is no other green on the page, I expect the link to stand out.</p>
            
            <p>If the link stands out, I expect the goal to be triggered 30% to 50% of the time.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Results</h2>

          <a href="#"> <!--results graph will go here-->
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-A-overveiw.PNG" alt="Image of the audience overview from google, a jagged line shows activity rising and falling for the past month.">
            </a> <span class="caption text-muted">Google Audience Overview</span>

            <p>I had to set the parameters back to the beginning of the quarter to get some data, the instructions indicated just a few days of data but there unfortunately was not
              much there. 
            </p>

            <p><strong>Things that I noticed:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Most of the users to my site were new users, this made sense as the journal is only about 7 weeks old.</li>
              <li>Users spent an average of about 7 minutes on the page at a time.</li>
              <li>Users tended to look at about 28 pages before leaving (wow!)</li>
              <li>In total, the pages have been viewed 2,073 times...that figure blew me away!</li>
            </ul>


            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-A-5w's.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Google Analytics page. charts indicate that the site is viewed most often in the morning, and late at night.
            it is viewed by people in the USA and 72% of the users visited via a desktop computer rather than a mobile device.">
          </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Detail of Google Analytics information page</span>

          <p>As expected, all of my users were in the United States, I was surprised to see when people were most likely to be looking:</p>

          <p>On the weekends, the site picked up trafic between the hours of 8 am and 2 pm...(prime homework hours)</p>

          <p>During the weekdays, traffic focused on the evening hours with most users arriving sometime between 5 and 10 pm.</p>

          <p><strong>Mobile vs. Desktop</strong></p>
          
          <p>With so much emphasis on Mobile I was surprised to see much more desktop access, this is likely due to the fact that we tend to complete our
            homework on laptops/desktops so that is what we would be using to access each others' journals. 
          </p>

          <p><strong>The most popular page:</strong></p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-A-popular.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Google Analytics page. post 6 (Accessibility) is the most popular with 264 view, next is this current page at 195.">
          </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Posts by Popularity</span>

            <p>Blame it on "Game of Thrones Fever" but accessibility-retrofit indeed proved to be the most popluar post. It's exciting to be
              able to see how users are reacting to your content and which posts are they being drawn to/coming back to. 
            </p>

          <!--<blockquote class="blockquote">NOT SURE IF I REALLY NEED THIS NOW, TAKE OUT IF NO</blockquote>-->

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>It's really useful to be able to see so much of what is drawing users to your site, but Google Analytics is not a perfect system. </p>

              <p>I was disappointed to see that the Demographic Information was not included in the evaluation. I need to do a little more research to see if this 
              is information that I need to collect myself (include a survey which asks)</p>
              
              <p>or if this is something which will fill up over time (keep adding new posts and wait for the Google Magic)</p>
                
              

              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/US-A-Demographics.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Google Analytics page. there is no data collected on this. ">
          </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">Detail of Google Analytics Demographics Page</span>

              <p>I had dabbled with the idea of using Google Analytics before giving it a try on this website, but I never thought that it would be
                as powerful a tool. 
              </p>

              <p>These tools allow us to track how are site is being used, how often, and by whom. With this information, we can tailor the experience to invite 
                more and more users to come back. 
              </p>
